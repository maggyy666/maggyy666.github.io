                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The GoodFood Project is a community-driven recipe sharing platform built on the ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. Unlike traditional websites, MVC separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (handles user input and interacts with the model and view).</p>
